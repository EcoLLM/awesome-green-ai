# Awesome Green AI ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ±

*A curated list of awesome Green AI resources and tools to reduce the environmental impacts of using and deploying AI.*

In 2020, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector carbon footprint was estimated to be between 2.1-3.9% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. The ICT sector [continues to grow and now dominates other industries](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). It is estimated that the carbon footprint will double to 6-8% by 2025. For ICT sector to remain compliant with the Paris Agreement, the industry must reduce by 45% its GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 ([Freitag et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340)).

AI is one of the fastest growing sectors, disrupting many other industries ([AI Market Size Report, 2022](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market)). It therefore has an important role to play in reducing carbon footprint. The impacts of ICT, and therefore AI, are not limited to GHG emissions and electricity consumption. We need to take into account all major impacts (abiotic resource depletion, primary energy consumption, water usage, etc.) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ([Arushanyan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2013.10.003)).

AI sobriety not only means optimizing energy consumption and reducing impacts, but also includes studies on [indirect impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)#Direct_and_indirect_effects) and [rebound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) that can negate all efforts to reduce the environmental footprint ([Willenbacher et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88063-7_5)). It is therefore imperative to consider the use of AI before launching a project in order to avoid indirect impacts and rebound effects later on.
